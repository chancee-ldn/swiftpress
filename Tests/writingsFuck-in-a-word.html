<p>This is surprising because Chaucer had about a dozen different spellings of the word 'cunt'. The <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/mind-your-language/9643532/the-remarkable-discovery-of-roger-fuckebythenavele/">document in question</a> also contains liberal use of the term 'windfucker' and 'fuckbeggar' which I will be incorporating into my lexicon with all haste.</p><blockquote><p>A great discovery has been made by Dr Paul Booth, a fellow of Keele University. It is a 14th-century example of fuck. We might think the word Anglo-Saxon, but itâ€™s hard to find written examples before the 16th century. Chaucer never uses it. The earliest citation in the Oxford English Dictionary is in a poem from 1500 in the surprising form gxddbov. That is a cipher which, by shifting each letter back a place in the alphabet, reveals fuccant, a dog-Latin third person plural of the verb.</p></blockquote><h5>Fuck in a word</h5><h4>2015-09-28 23:00:00 +0000</h4>
