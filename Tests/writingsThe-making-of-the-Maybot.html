<p>The Guardians sketch writer <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnJCrace?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">John Crace</a> coined the term Maybot and does a good job <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/10/making-maybot-theresa-may-rise-and-fall">chronicling the rise and fall</a> of May - it's a year since Cameron resigned.</p><blockquote><p>Not that anyone appeared to have told the Maybot the election result. Either that or she was trapped in the first phase of election grief: denial. There had been no election. She hadn’t blown a 20-point lead in the opinion polls in just over seven weeks. She hadn’t just run the worst campaign in living memory. She hadn’t published a manifesto that had needed to be pulped before the ink was dry. Everything was normal. Nothing had happened. She was still the Supreme Leader. All was well.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Maybot’s punishment would be to remain as prime minister. In just a year, the Maybot had imploded entirely. It had come to this – from being lauded as the saviour of the Conservative party to begging Labour for some policy ideas. A year in which her true mediocrity had been exposed.</p></blockquote><h5>The making of the Maybot</h5><h4>2017-07-10 23:00:00 +0000</h4>
