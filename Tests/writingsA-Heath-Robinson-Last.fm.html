<p>Since the first iteration (what are we, version five now?) of this site I've always had somewhere that tracked the <a href="http://lifu.ink/materiel/">latest music</a> I'd been listening to. Until today I powered that through a madcap combination of Last.fm and PHP (fuck PHP). It had always irked me that the only page preventing the whole site being static was that one script.</p><p>Then iTunes Radio launched and changed the dynamic. Less music is going into my library, 'loved' tracks are a new paradigm (binary, not measured in degrees like a star rating), combine the fact I flick between radio stations and my own library and the the data set was already skewed. As far as last.fm is concerned all I've listened to for a week is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/kill-the-wolf/id983253303">B.Dolans badass new album</a>.</p><p>The solution I came up with was to devise a small Applescript which sits on Dropbox and generates a text file by querying a Smart Playlist in iTunes periodically (via Cron). It's fairly easy to follow, save this script as an Applescript, change this_playlist to suit your target playlist, run, and a text file should pop out in the folder where you saved the script. My version wraps each track in an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag so it can flow into a list nicely.</p><p>UPDATE: It's come to my attention no one seems to know who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Heath_Robinson">Heath Robinson</a> was - he was an English illustrator famous for drawings of overly complicated contraptions to solve simple problems.</p><pre><code class="language-applescript">tell application "iTunes"
