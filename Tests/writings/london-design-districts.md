> London may lack the density of Paris’s design gallery culture or the intensity of Milan’s incredible mix of design and production. It may occasionally use design to impart a fabricated identity on bland and overpriced developments. It might also be a city in which creatives are increasingly unable to find studio space and manufacturers, and makers are unable to find factories. Yet it still somehow manages to make its streets the fascinating conduits through which the energy of a real design culture runs. Its cocktail of the commercial and the cultural makes it unique and, no matter how cynical you might become, an undeniable current of creativity and hope thrums through it.
