[Good breakdown of the Marcon leak](https://medium.com/dfrlab/macronleaks-campaign-hits-resistance-4fa490e4ae55), and how is was spurned by the French.

>The leak appeared 36 hours before the opening of polls in the decisive round of France’s presidential election. This seemed a last-ditch effort by supporters of nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen to torpedo Macron, who is some 20 points ahead in the polls.

I heard Marcon's people seeded his servers with obviously fake documents, to quickly snuff out any potential twitter storms, a bit like a [trap street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street) in cartography.
 
> These posts did not stop alt-right and far-right accounts tweeting, but they challenged the hashtag and achieved thousands of retweets of their own. This suggests that the #MacronLeaks campaign, after an initial rapid penetration of the information space, met significant resistance — and may well have had its spread and ability to influence voters limited as a result.
