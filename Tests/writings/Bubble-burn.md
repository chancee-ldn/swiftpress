Typemag has a round up on Coke's new typeface and it's worth reading for the [sick burns](https://www.typemag.org/home/2018/1/11/critics-are-divided-on-coka-colas-new-typeface) alone.

> Coca-Cola continues to operate under the mindset that its sinking soda ship is a brand problem rather than a product problem. It believes a green can of Coke will exude feelings of longevity, and that self-referential nostalgia will be enough to re-anchor it in the hearts of consumers, if presented again, and again, and again. These are the sentiments of VPs who donâ€™t realize that the world has changed.

Boom.
