I've been learning Swift for the past few months, after having to use Node and Flask - I definitely think a server running Swift rather than some unholy Nginx-Lighttpd frankenstein is going to be the next thing running this site.

[IBM are certainly seeming serious](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/kitura/) about it. And there are the [usual plethora](https://stormpath.com/blog/swift-on-the-server-today) of rival frameworks for any new language.
