Michael Skapinker on the UKs challenge of being a monolingual society:

> One essay describes EU meetings where everyone speaks English without anyone bothering with the interpreters. “But when a British or Irish participant takes the floor, you can often notice that some participants suddenly grab their earphones.”

> The problem is native speakers’ over-use of figurative phrases. The essay describes a television interviewer baffling then-French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron in a discussion about the rise of the far-right by asking him “So how would you buck that trend?”

I think I'm very guilty of speaking in idioms.
