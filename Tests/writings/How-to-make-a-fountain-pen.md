[Fantastic transcription](https://fountainpendesign.wordpress.com/fountain-pen-nib/nib-manufacturing-slitting-tipping-quality/nib-manufacture-1879/) of an article from Scientific American (1879) on how fountain pens are manufactured. Comfortingly, not a lot has changed.

>   The nib is placed on a piece of pumice rock, which you can see the second worker holding.  There are thin articulated gas pipes reaching out from the wall.  At its end permanently burns a tiny flame, much smaller than the one on a cigarette lighter. The second worker holds the mouthpiece his hand and directs the flame towards the nib. When he blows into the pipe the flame forms a point and gets much hotter.  Through adjusting the amount of air he blows he controls the temperature.)
