I possibly had a romantic version in my head of [Music Halls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_hall) being quite base. Sounds like it was much more [orchestrated and nefarious](https://theibtaurisblog.com/2012/08/07/songs-for-the-masses-political-expression-in-the-victorian-music-hall/) than that, by [Fern Riddell](https://twitter.com/FernRiddell).

> From the 1870s onwards the music halls were manipulated by an increasing level of middle-class control, which sort to neutralize any form of working class political discontent. They were used as a conduit for propaganda, and instead of speaking for the people the halls moulded their political temperament through increased patriotic fervour and a focus on domestic life.
