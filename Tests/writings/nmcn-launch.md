I've just finished piecing [laying out some new works](http://nmcn.co) for [Ben White](https://twitter.com/benwhitesocial) and [Steve Cole](https://twitter.com/stevencoleuk) where they are talking about the fall of old media and the rise of new media creators. It's explosive stuff.

Big thanks to [Sally Shiny Stars](http://www.sallyshinystars.com) for some awesome sketch work and to [Guru](https://my.guru.co.uk/?affid=25880) for cloud servers that took an absolute beating at launch with no complaints.
