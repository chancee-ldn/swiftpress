[Oliver Kamm](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/register/asterix-is-the-magic-potion-that-made-me-a-linguist-f982jlk5t) on the delicate translations of Asterix to English. I genuinely had no idea jokes don't translate across languages. Surely _dwarf shortage_ would?

> In _Asterix and the Goths_, an early adventure of the indomitable Gauls, a couple of Roman legionaries stumble across two of their colleagues gagged and bound. Mistaking them for the outlaws they’re hunting, one legionary exclaims: “Look! A fat one and a little one! Visigoths!!!” To which his comrade replies: “Visi Goths? Why the past tense?”
