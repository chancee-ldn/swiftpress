The bureau [Amin Taha](http://amintaha.co.uk/#) is about to break ground on an innovative (and beautiful) [apartment block](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/amin-taha-reveals-plans-for-10-storey-flats-with-load-bearing-stone-structure/10021592.article).

> The proposal at Finchley Road will be the first 10-storey, loadbearing self-finished stone structure without the need of stainless steel reinforcing threads or secondary structure, since the last stone cathedrals were erected. In addition to its architectonic aesthetic, this construction approach, which also uses exposed CLT floor slabs spanning between the exoskeleton, saves around 18 per cent from cost and more again from the embodied carbon over conventional construction methods.
