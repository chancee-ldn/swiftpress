[Sam Kriss wraps up](https://samkriss.com/2017/07/17/the-iron-law-of-online-abuse/) and takes down Nick Cohen
> Nick Cohen gets the honours, firstly because he’s just awful, and secondly because he’s such a luminously dumb exemplar of this tendency: in [column](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/j-k-rowling-curse-left/) after [column](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/good-and-brave-labour-mps-should-be-defended) he condemns the vicious epithets suffered by MPs and public figures, grouching for civility and good, clean, open debate – but, when he’s not play-acting at high-mindedness, he compares socialists in solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution to [sex tourists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/22/radical-leftwing-tourists-pimps-dictatorship-hugo-chavez-venezuela-sex-tourism), flings [antisemitic stereotypes](https://samkriss.com/2016/05/23/nick-cohen-is-in-your-house/) at anti-Zionist Jews, and apostrophises Corbyn’s supporters as [‘fucking fools.’](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/19/jeremy-corbyn-labour-threat-party-election-support)

He uses big words and is funny as shit.
