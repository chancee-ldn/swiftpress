This latest incarnation of this site now has the blog powered by a piece of magic called [Letterpress](http://wangling.me/2013/01/letterpress.html), developed by the talented [Ling Wang](https://github.com/an0). Once deployed it means I can save plain ol' markdown files into my dropbox, where they sync with Guru's cloud servers and render out static HTML. No muss, no fuss, a very happy me, and should let me post a little more regularly.

> I just want a minimal blogging system with good writing experience. Only static text files, no dynamic HTML generated from database. No RSS/Atom. No comments. And no PHP.

Yeah. Fuck you PHP! The man makes sense. I made some slight tweaks to the engine, as I tend to post short snippets rather than full length articles which would need an excerpt. I'll post that update onto GitHub at some point.
