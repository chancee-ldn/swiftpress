> Currently (Sept 2015), Alphabettes is a loose network of 87 members from around the world. Pay them a visit on their websites, hire them, license their work, invite them to talk, or send them cake. They are all fantastic. You can also find most of them on here.

Very pleased to see [this](http://www.alphabettes.org) appear, it has one hell of a roll call; including [Indra Kupferschmid](http://kupferschrift.de/cms/), [Amy Papaelias](http://www.amypapaelias.com) and [Laura Worthington](http://lauraworthingtontype.com).

As an aside, the site has a nice [death to bullshit](http://deathtobullshit.com) vibe. Which I like.
