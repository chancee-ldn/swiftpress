I've never used facebook, but [this sounds](https://medium.com/@stevencole/why-i-disconnected-from-the-facebook-130e92fcb1a1#.5jeuqa5jh) mortifying.

> I remember the old profiles. The ones where it only ever held your last 5 posts and once you posted another the bottom one disappeared (or that’s what you thought at the time)
I remember the chronological newsfeed and using FB to talk about TV shows and sport with genuine family and friends (although I now do that on Twitter with strangers because of FB’s algorithm).
I remember the prefix “Steve is….” — I used to write all kinds of crap on Facebook with wild abandon, as the ‘on this day’ feature has come to remind me. I’m not sure about anyone else, but I have spent the last year or so deleting all of my past posts using that feature.
