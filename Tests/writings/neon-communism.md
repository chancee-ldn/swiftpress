>  [Made in North Korea bills itself](https://www.ft.com/content/622e9756-1ae6-11e8-a748-5da7d696ccab) as a rare glimpse into a graphic culture developed in isolation. But the relationship between domestic and international politics is more complex than it appears at first glance. You might come across cute pastel wrapping paper adorned with Pyongyang architectural landmarks, made for tourists — the work of some North Korean Wes Anderson — or even an improbable set of commemorative stamps celebrating the UK’s Princess Diana, created in 1982 to mark the birth of Prince William. 

It's on until May 13th at [House of Illustration](http://www.houseofillustration.org.uk).
