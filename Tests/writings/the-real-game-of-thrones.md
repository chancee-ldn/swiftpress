Back in 2015 an archaeological survey was undertaken in Barnet, in search of the site of a decisive War of the Roses battle. Looks like they found it!

> “This was a battle that involved three kings (Edward IV, Henry VI and the future Richard III), two armies and one crown, so Barnet has plenty to shout about – and we are determined to make our contribution towards regenerating the town centre, and in putting Barnet on the map.”

There's a great [illustrated paper](http://barnetmuseum.weebly.com/uploads/2/3/7/0/23701864/battle_of_barnet_paper_john_northam.pdf) by a local historian called John Northam where you can get your geek on.
