<p>Short <a href="http://player.bfi.org.uk/film/watch-sunshine-in-soho-1956">film from 1956</a> documenting Soho in the 50s. Astonishly modern and vibrant.</p><blockquote><p>This gloriously colourful day-in-the-life portrait of mid-50s Soho and its annual Summer Fair is a nostalgia trip for anyone familiar with central London's beloved bohemian sanctuary - or what's left of it. This was a thriving and truly multicultural community: Italian delis, French patisseries and Greek-Cypriot cafes jostled for space alongside jazz bars like the Granada, while market traders hawked exotic foods yet to be discovered by most British people (aubergine, anyone?).</p></blockquote><p>I particularly enjoyed this passage (4:00) "Here you will meet many nationalities, and hear many languages. At almost any time of the day - or night, you will see groups of Swiss, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Cypriot and coloured nationals in or near the many cafe bars. All minding their own business, in their own way."</p><p>The waiters race (15:00) is also something to behold! Complete with jaunty music.</p><h5>Street markets in Soho in 1956</h5><h4>2016-03-19 00:00:00 +0000</h4>
