<blockquote><p>There are just five preserved skins of Jerdon’s courser that survive and two of them are in the ornithological collection at the Natural History Museum, Tring. A colleague Stuart Piertney took scrapings from the membrane lining the inside the mystery egg and shavings from a toe-pad from one of the two courser skins. “The sequences obtained from the egg and the toe-pad were identical, indicating that they had come from the same species”</p></blockquote><p>You can only imagine what kind <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/animal-magic/2015/jun/25/rare-egg-specimen-discovered-museum-jerdons-courser">of story</a> involves a tiny egg from an already presumably extinct species from India surviving the trip to Aberdeen in 1917.
