<p>A <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2017/06/10/cooling-the-tube-engineering-heat-out-of-the-underground/">structural engineer has gone full bore geek</a> on the problem that is cooling Londons tube system.</p><p>I could have done without learning this:</p><blockquote><p>In fact, when the early tube tunnels were dug, they were so cool down there that the cool tube was seen as a respite from the summer heat on the surface. Why suffer on a bus in the heat when thereâ€™s a cool tube to take instead, said the marketing men.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Over the years, the heat from the trains soaked into the clay to the point where it can no longer absorb any more heat. Tunnels that were a mere 14 degrees Celsius in the 1900s can now have air temperatures as high as 30 degrees Celsius on parts of the tube network.</p></blockquote><h5>Clay tombs</h5><h4>2017-06-15 23:00:00 +0000</h4>
