<p>I'm tragic at keeping cash expenses, the original shoebox of receipts I add up once a year is plainly not efficient. So, I present The Worlds Smallest Spreadsheetâ„¢:<br><code></code>` Transaction,Date,Total,Notes TFL,08/05/2017,7.10,Travel to Victoria TFL,09/05/2017,7.10,Travel to Kings Cross TFL,25/05/2018,7.20,Travel to London Bridge The Bull,25/05/2018,24.80,Lunch with Agent The Bohemia,26/05/2018,39.05,Drinks with Directors</p><pre><code>  
  
Save that as a CSV, then to get a total run this:
  
</code></pre><p>awk -F',' '{sum+=$3} END {print sum}' May-2018.csv</p><pre><code>  
  
Once I've done a few months I'll write a script to run though the months and create a tally. I'm happy, the accountant is happy, and the shoebox can go in the bin.
Before you @ me, no, I don't wanna run Numbers or a spreadsheet app, I nearly always have [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) open to massage copy/type, and I can access a text editor on my phone via dropbox. Sorted.</code></pre><h5>Worlds smallest spreadsheet</h5><h4>2018-05-29 23:00:00 +0000</h4>
