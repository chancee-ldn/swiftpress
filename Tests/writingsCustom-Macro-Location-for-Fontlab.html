<p>This is mainly for myself, as I keep forgetting. You can store your Application Support for Fontlab in a Dropbox folder. First move your user file location for Fontlab via: <code>Preferences &gt; General Options &gt; Folders and paths</code> and change the User Data Files to your Dropbox location. For me that is: <code>Users/Leigh/Dropbox/Application Support/Fontlab/Studio 5/Macros</code></p><p>Then restart Fontlab and it should look in there for scripts - handy for when you keep working off multiple machines.</p><h5>Custom Macro Location for Fontlab</h5><h4>2015-09-24 23:00:00 +0000</h4>
