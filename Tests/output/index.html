Cities definitely lose something when they stop being able to manufacture.</p><blockquote><p>London may lack the density of Paris‚Äôs design gallery culture or the intensity of Milan‚Äôs incredible mix of design and production. It may occasionally use design to impart a fabricated identity on bland and overpriced developments. It might also be a city in which creatives are increasingly unable to find studio space and manufacturers, and makers are unable to find factories. Yet it still somehow manages to make its streets the fascinating conduits through which the energy of a real design culture runs. Its cocktail of the commercial and the cultural makes it unique and, no matter how cynical you might become, an undeniable current of creativity and hope thrums through it.</p></blockquote><h2>Design districts</h2><h3>2018-09-10 23:00:00 +0000</h3><blockquote><p>The signs, written in English and the Musqueam language of h…ônÃìqÃì…ôminÃì…ômÃì, sway away from conventional directions such as, north, south, east and west.

Comfortingly, not a lot has changed.</p><blockquote><p>The nib is placed on a piece of pumice rock, which you can see the second worker holding. There are thin articulated gas pipes reaching out from the wall. At its end permanently burns a tiny flame, much smaller than the one on a cigarette lighter. The second worker holds the mouthpiece his hand and directs the flame towards the nib. When he blows into the pipe the flame forms a point and gets much hotter.
