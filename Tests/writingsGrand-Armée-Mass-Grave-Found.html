<blockquote><p>Both Pelier and Holder tested the bones of women as well as men. But why would there have been women in a mass grave of Napoleonic soldiers? Owre told me that “there were plenty of camp followers as well as official woman cantinières and vivandières who sold goods to the troops. This woman from southern France would likely have been one of these or a follower.

Look at these statistics for the battle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Borodino">Borodino</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"...while the infantry and cavalry discharged 1,400,000 musket-shots, but even that averages out at a hundred cannon shots and 2300 rounds of musketry per minute" - Zamoyski</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"a fully-loaded 747 crashing, with no survivors, every 5 minutes for eight hours." - Dyer</p></blockquote><p>It's thought as little as 20,000 returned with their colours.
