<p>This is a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de6c9816-6251-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1">very cool idea</a>.</p><blockquote><p>The proposal, which the architects have been working on for eight years after winning a competition, is to excavate the land — one of the country’s largest remaining deposits of high-quality gravel — in sections and for concrete basements to be progressively built below.</p></blockquote><p>I particularly like the part that the gaps between the concrete basements will have sufficient depth that trees can take root and that they have plans to use the ground space below for warehousing. Next to Heathrow. It's clever work from <a href="http://www.carmodygroarke.com/Rectory_Farm/index.html">Carmody Groarke</a>.</p><h5>Urban planning done right</h5><h4>2017-07-07 23:00:00 +0000</h4>
