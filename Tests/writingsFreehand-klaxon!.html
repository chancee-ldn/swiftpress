<p>Well happy with discovering <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/">this gem</a> of an app. After many many years, finally a vector drawing app with Freehand like controls for vector handles. I'm soooooo happy. For Â£40. That's the same price as a single month of the Creative Cloud, and here's some of the things <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/">Affinity</a> can do that Illustrator can't:</p><ol><li>Custom grids (isometric, obliques....)</li><li>Did i mention the vector handles work like Freehand?</li><li>Sessionless undos (undo past save states)</li><li>Image slicing</li><li>The save speed is CRAZY fast</li><li>Hasn't crashed yet</li><li>Opened a document 32000px wide and didn't tell me I couldn't (Illustrator caps out at 16383px, for no reason. At all)</li></ol><h5>Freehand klaxon!</h5><h4>2015-09-07 23:00:00 +0000</h4>
