Comfortingly, not a lot has changed.</p><blockquote><p>The nib is placed on a piece of pumice rock, which you can see the second worker holding. There are thin articulated gas pipes reaching out from the wall. At its end permanently burns a tiny flame, much smaller than the one on a cigarette lighter. The second worker holds the mouthpiece his hand and directs the flame towards the nib. When he blows into the pipe the flame forms a point and gets much hotter. Through adjusting the amount of air he blows he controls the temperature.)</p></blockquote><h5>How to make a fountain pen</h5><h4>2018-03-06 00:00:00 +0000</h4>
