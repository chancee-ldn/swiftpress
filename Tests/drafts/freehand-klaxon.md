Well happy with discovering [this gem](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) of an app. After many many years, finally a vector drawing app with Freehand like controls for vector handles. I'm soooooo happy. For Â£40. That's the same price as a single month of the Creative Cloud, and here's some of the things [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) can do that Illustrator can't:

1. Custom grids (isometric, obliques....)
2. Did i mention the vector handles work like Freehand?
3. Sessionless undos (undo past save states)
4. Image slicing
5. The save speed is CRAZY fast
6. Hasn't crashed yet
7. Opened a document 32000px wide and didn't tell me I couldn't (Illustrator caps out at 16383px, for no reason. At all)
