> Each building required hours of exploration to find the perfect vantage point whether it be from a rooftop, stairwell or road workers crane lift I commandeered to capture the Nagakin from an otherwise impossible perspective. Though these buildings are from the past (most from 1970-1999) they appear as if they have appeared from the distant future. My intention is for the viewer to ask not “where” they were taken but “when”.

Unique view on a city, reminds me of the [TDR 3D>2D](https://www.amazon.co.uk/3d-Designers-Republics-Adventures-Architecture/dp/3823854925) piece.
