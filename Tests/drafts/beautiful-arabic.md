Really enjoyed this short essay from [Soulaf Khalifeh](http://www.alphabettes.org/remember-december-reflections-on-arabic-literature-calligraphy-and-type/) on typesetting in Arabic.

> The multilingual education system in Lebanon gave us the privilege of reading literature classics in three different languages. But Arabic has always had its unique aura, enchanting me with its subtle grammar and with how the interplay of short and long vowels, along with other rhetorical elements, can overhaul its semantics and enrich its rhythm.

It's only when you learn a language (or an alphabet) alien to your own do you appreciate the uniqueness of your native one.
