This is mainly for myself, as I keep forgetting.
You can store your Application Support for Fontlab in a Dropbox folder. First move your user file location for Fontlab via: `Preferences > General Options > Folders and paths` and change the User Data Files to your Dropbox location. For me that is: `Users/Leigh/Dropbox/Application Support/Fontlab/Studio 5/Macros`

Then restart Fontlab and it should look in there for scripts - handy for when you keep working off multiple machines.
