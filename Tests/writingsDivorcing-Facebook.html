<p>I've never used facebook, but <a href="https://medium.com/@stevencole/why-i-disconnected-from-the-facebook-130e92fcb1a1#.5jeuqa5jh">this sounds</a> mortifying.</p><blockquote><p>I remember the old profiles. The ones where it only ever held your last 5 posts and once you posted another the bottom one disappeared (or that’s what you thought at the time)I remember the chronological newsfeed and using FB to talk about TV shows and sport with genuine family and friends (although I now do that on Twitter with strangers because of FB’s algorithm).I remember the prefix “Steve is….” — I used to write all kinds of crap on Facebook with wild abandon, as the ‘on this day’ feature has come to remind me. I’m not sure about anyone else, but I have spent the last year or so deleting all of my past posts using that feature.</p></blockquote><h5>Divorcing Facebook</h5><h4>2016-11-16 00:00:00 +0000</h4>
